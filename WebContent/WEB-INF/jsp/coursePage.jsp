      <p>You learned a little Javascript,  but you still look at sites with slick, smooth elegant user interfaces and wonder:  How DO they do that.  Here's a secret-- The answer is AJAX.  Asynchronous Javascript and XML.  If you want to make pages on your web application respond quickly, and with a minimum of screen refreshes, this IS the technology to learn.
        
        With a little Javascript knowlege you can use AJAX to take database information and store, alter, sort and conditionally format it all on the client side.  This minimizes the load on your sever and makes your applications respond quickly and without reloading the HTML page.  AJAX comminicates wth the server behind the scenes while your user continues to use your web site, accessing the information they want.
        
        In this course master trainer Mark Lassoff takes you through the basics of AJAX righ to advanced topics like parsing JSON responses from web services.  This couse is recommended for all web developers who want to improve their client side skills, and make killer responsive web applications. </p>

        About Mark-- The Guy Behind LearnToProgram.tv
        
        Mark Lassoffâ€™s parents frequently claim that he was born to be a programmer. In the mid-eighties, when the neighborhood kids were outside playing kickball and throwing snowballs, Mark was hard at work on his Commodore 64 writing games in the BASIC programming language. Computers and programming continued to be a strong interest in college where Mark majored in Communications and Computer Science. After completing his college career, Mark worked in the software and web development departments at several large corporations.
        
        In 2001, on a whim, while his contemporaries were conquering the dot com world, Mark accepted a position training programmers in a technical training center in Austin, Texas. It was there that Mark fell in love with teaching programming, which has been his passion ever since. Today Mark is a top technical trainer, traveling the country providing training for software and web developers. Mark's training clients include the Department of Defense, Lockheed Martin, Discover Card Services, and Kaiser Permanente. He has consulted for companies such as Dell, Target, Lockheed Martin, and government agencies including the US House of Representatives. In addition to traditional classroom training and consulting, Mark releases video tutorial training for aspiring programmers on his  </p><span class="one">Leactures:</span>
